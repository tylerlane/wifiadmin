WEB SERVER SPECIFIC NOTES FOR SPEEDTEST.NET MINI

*** IIS6 using ASP (changes not needed for ASP.NET) ***
IIS6 won't allow POST requests larger than 200K to be performed, and ASP scripts are disabled by default. It is also a good idea to disable chunked transfer encoding.

To increase the maximum allowed POST request size and disable chunked transfer encoding:
- Open IIS Manager
- Right-click on the server name at the top of the tree and choose "Properties"
- Check the first box for "Enable Direct Metabase Edit" and click the "OK" button
- Open C:\Windows\System32\Inetsrv\metabase.xml with Notepad (NOT Wordpad)
- Find AspMaxRequestEntityAllowed and change it to 1073741824
- Find AspEnableChunkedEncoding and set it to False

To make sure ASP scripts are enabled:
- Open IIS Manager
- In the console tree pane (the pane on the left), click "Web Service Extensions"
- In the details pane (the pane on the right), click "Active Server Pages" and then click the "Allow" button 

*** Apache using PHP ***
Apache on some distributions disallow POST requests over 512K. This will cause the upload portion of the test to hang on faster connections.

To correct this problem:
 - Open php.conf or php.ini
 - Find LimitRequestBody and remove that line
 - Restart Apache (/etc/init.d/httpd restart)
